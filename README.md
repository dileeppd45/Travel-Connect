# Travel-Connect
Travel Connect is a web application designed to reduce traffic and save petroleum and other energy resources used by vehicles, as well as to save time and money.

This online platform allows users to schedule their travel using their own vehicles or others.

For example, if you want to travel from one place to another, you can search the site to find a vehicle going in the same direction. Similarly, if you plan to travel from one place to another with your vehicle, you can add your travel plan to the site, including all the routes you will pass through and the number of available seats.

Once you add your plan, it will be visible to the public, and those who need transportation can book a seat in your vehicle.

The website stores the details of registered users, registered vehicles, and booking information in its database. The platform is accessible to two types of users: administrators and the public. The public can either travel using others' vehicles or offer rides to others while traveling. The application is maintained and managed by administrators, who have the authority to approve or reject public vehicle registrations after verification.
